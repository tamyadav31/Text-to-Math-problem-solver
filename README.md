# Text-to-Math-Problem-Solver

## Overview

Text-to-Math-Problem-Solver is an AI-powered assistant designed to interpret natural language math problems, perform calculations, and provide detailed, step-by-step explanations. Using NVIDIAâ€™s Groq-powered LLM models via LangChain, this application can also retrieve relevant contextual information from Wikipedia and apply logical reasoning to solve complex problems, all accessible through an easy-to-use Streamlit web app.

## Features

- **Natural Language Math Problem Solving:** Enter word problems or mathematical queries in plain English and receive accurate, logically reasoned answers.
- **Multi-Tool Agent:** Combines tools including Wikipedia search, an LLM-powered math calculator (LLMMathChain), and a custom reasoning tool to provide comprehensive answers.
- **Detailed Explanations:** Responses are broken down point-wise for clarity and educational purposes.
- **Interactive Streamlit Interface:** Seamless user experience for asking questions and viewing results.
- **Real-Time Conversation Memory:** Tracks chat history within the session for back-and-forth interactions.
- **Secure API Key Management:** Uses environment variables and sidebar input for Groq API key.

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

text

3. **Install required dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

text

4. **Configure your Groq API key**
- Create a `.env` file in the project root containing:
  ```
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
  ```
- Alternatively, enter your API key in the sidebar input when running the app.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit web app**
streamlit run app.py

text

2. **In the interface:**
- Provide your Groq API key via the sidebar.
- Enter your math or reasoning question in the text area.
- Click **Find My Answer** to receive a detailed solution and reasoning process.

3. **Example Question:**
I have 5 bananas and 7 grapes. I eat 2 bananas and give away 3 grapes. Then I buy a dozen apples and 2 packs of blueberries containing 25 berries. How many total pieces of fruit do I have at the end?
